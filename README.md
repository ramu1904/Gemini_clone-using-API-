AI chatbots like Google Gemini or ChatGPT have changed how we interact with technology, making conversations with machines almost human.
As a beginner web developer, have you ever thought about building your own AI chatbot? The good news is that it is possible to build a Google Gemini-like chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It uses artificial intelligence to produce human-like responses and has become popular for its natural conversational abilities.

This project is a clone of the Gemini platform, built using the official Gemini API.

This project not only improves your web development skills but also gives you practical experience in integrating APIs and managing application states.
